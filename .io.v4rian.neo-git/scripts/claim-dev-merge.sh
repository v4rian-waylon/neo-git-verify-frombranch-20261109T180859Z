# claim-dev-merge.sh - git-native claim of the next dev version.
#
# Run this LOCALLY on the `dev` branch immediately after a working-branch
# PR has landed (via GitHub merge-button, manual `git merge --no-ff`, or
# any other path). Tags the merge commit with the dev version returned
# by `bin/version --seal`. No VERSION file is touched - tags are the
# canonical version state ("seal of approval"). No CI required.
#
# This script is the canonical source of truth for the dev → dev claim
# operation. It is the same logic CI would run, but it runs from git, on
# anyone's machine, with no GitHub Actions dependency.
#
# Version derivation: this script never computes the dev tag itself.
# `bin/version` is the single authority for version math across the
# template (claim flow, open-pr, build-on-tag, auto-rebase, status).
# The script's only job here is to consume what `bin/version` returns
# and tag the merge commit with it. The flag used is `--seal`: claim
# runs AFTER the pool->dev merge has landed, so the merge already
# counts in `bin/version`'s first-parent walk and `--seal` returns the
# correct vYEAR.SERIES.DEV value for that merge commit. `--next-dev`
# is what the FOLLOWING merge would claim.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Verify HEAD is `dev`
#   2. Refuse tracked changes; untracked files left in place
#   3. Sync with origin/dev (unless --skip-pull): fast-forward only, keep
#      an unpushed local merge, adopt only an amended twin, else refuse
#   4. Ask `bin/version --seal` for the tag to claim on the merge commit
#   5. Refuse if the tag already exists (claim is already in)
#   6. Annotated-tag HEAD, push tag
#   7. Invoke auto-rebase-pools-after-dev-merge.sh as a best-effort pass
#
# Dependencies: bash, git.
#
# Usage:
#   claim-dev-merge.sh                  do the claim
#   claim-dev-merge.sh --dry-run        show what would happen, no mutations
#   claim-dev-merge.sh --skip-pull      skip the origin/dev sync
#   claim-dev-merge.sh -h | --help      print this help

#      origin (it always does at claim time - the GitHub-side merge button
#      keeps the head branch alive until claim's archive step deletes it).
