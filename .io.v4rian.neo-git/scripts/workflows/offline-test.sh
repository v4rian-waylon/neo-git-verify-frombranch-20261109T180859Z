#!/usr/bin/env bash
# offline-test.sh - body of the offline-test workflow's lifecycle job.
#
# Default mode runs the framework's own internal test suites (lifecycle +
# hooks) when this repo is the framework source (detected via the
# FRAMEWORK_REPO marker file). On a consumer repo that has adopted the
# framework, the marker is absent and the suites SHOULD NOT run - those
# tests verify the framework's own machinery, not the consumer's project.
#
# The marker file gate is the single source of truth for "is this the
# framework's home repo?" Read it here, check it in audit scripts that
# fall through to framework-internal recipes, drop it via bootstrap-ci
# consumer-cleanup, restore it on the framework source. No other source
# of truth, no environment variable, no remote-URL guess. This
# self-detection is what the default (no-flag) path preserves exactly.
#
# --throwaway mode reproduces the ENTIRE suite on an external throwaway
# repo - the consumer main use case - as a fully independent sandbox. It
# creates a real throwaway repo under the resolved token's account,
# pushes the CURRENT local tree to its main, clones it, and runs the
# plain suite FROM that clone. The clone resolves its own TEMPLATE_ROOT,
# origin, and workflows, so the run exercises only the tooling installed
# in the throwaway and never reaches back into this repo's CI, scripts,
# or origin. The throwaway's own Actions are disabled so the run costs no
# Actions minutes. Operator / pre-release use; NOT wired to per-push CI.
#
# Usage:
#   offline-test.sh                  default: marker-gated in-place suites
#   offline-test.sh --throwaway      full suite on an external throwaway repo
#   offline-test.sh --throwaway --keep      leave the throwaway alive
#   offline-test.sh --throwaway --dry-run   print the plan; no network
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  marker absent (consumer mode) -> skip is clean
#   0  marker present + both suites green
#   0  --throwaway with no resolvable token -> clean skip (never red)
#   non-zero  any suite red, or a throwaway provisioning step failed
#
# Environment:
#   LIFECYCLE_TEST_MODE  passed through to the suites so the claude/gh
#                        mocks engage; defaults to 1 in throwaway mode.
