#!/usr/bin/env bash
# audit-retry.sh - body of each audit-pushed-branch job's retry loop.
#
# Wraps a single audit script (compile / coverage / runtime / commit-audit)
# in an exponential-backoff retry loop. Same loop shape for every audit,
# so the jobs share one script instead of duplicating the bash. The audit
# script name is passed as --audit.
#
# Retry classification: not every non-zero rc is worth retrying. Test
# suites that ran to completion with assertions failing, syntax errors,
# panics, and consumer-side `consumer must override audits/X.sh` exits
# are deterministic - retrying them just burns minutes (8 attempts with
# 5/10/20/40/80/160/300/300 second backoff = ~15 minutes wasted on a
# failure that would never have flipped to green). Only transient
# failures (network blips, API rate limits, ephemeral resource pressure)
# benefit from retry.
#
# The wrapped audit script signals "this failure is worth retrying" in
# either of two equivalent ways:
#   (1) exit code 64 (RETRYABLE_EXIT_CODE), OR
#   (2) writing a line matching `^RETRYABLE:` to stderr (the wrapper
#       still expects a non-zero exit; the sentinel just classifies it
#       as transient).
# Anything else - any non-zero rc that is neither 64 nor accompanied by
# a RETRYABLE: stderr line - is treated as deterministic and fails fast
# on the first attempt.
#
# Exit code propagation: the wrapped audit's actual rc is captured
# directly via `bash cmd; rc=$?` (NOT via `if bash cmd; then exit 0; fi`
# which always reads rc=0 on the else branch - pool/n42's regression
# guard catches that pattern via the lifecycle suite).
#
# Usage:
#   audit-retry.sh --audit compile|coverage|runtime|commit-audit
#
# Environment:
#   MAX_ATTEMPTS  default 8
#   BASE_DELAY    default 5  (seconds; doubles per attempt)
#   MAX_DELAY     default 300 (cap on backoff)
