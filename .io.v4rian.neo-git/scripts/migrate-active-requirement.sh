# migrate-active-requirement.sh - move legacy lanes onto per-lane
# requirement files.
#
# Lanes allocated before the per-lane layout carry the single shared
# .io.v4rian.neo-git/active-requirement, so two of them merged into dev
# collide on it (add/add or modify/modify). This tool gives each such lane
# one commit that moves its text, byte for byte, to its own
# .io.v4rian.neo-git/requirements/<pool ref with / as __>
# (hg_requirement_path), after which every lane merges cleanly on any host.
#
# A lane qualifies when its tip tracks the shared file, it changed that file
# since it forked from dev (so the text is its own, not one inherited from
# dev), and it has no per-lane file yet.
#
# Lanes that share one legacy blob (a lane cut from another lane) must not
# all move it: two lanes renaming one file to two paths conflict
# rename/rename on dev. Per blob exactly one lane moves the text (the first
# by name in this run, unless another lane already moved that blob in an
# earlier run); every other lane only adds its lane file and leaves the
# shared file unchanged, which merges cleanly in any order. The shared file
# that remains on dev afterwards is dropped by the next allocated lane.
#
# The commit is made with plumbing,
# so no branch is checked out; a lane checked out in a worktree is updated
# there too (two-way read-tree), and is skipped when that worktree has
# uncommitted changes. Nothing is pushed.
#
# Usage:
#   migrate-active-requirement.sh               migrate every qualifying local lane
#   migrate-active-requirement.sh <branch>...   migrate the named lanes
#   migrate-active-requirement.sh --dry-run     list what would move
#   migrate-active-requirement.sh -h | --help
