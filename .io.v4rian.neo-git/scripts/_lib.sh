# _lib.sh - shared helpers for in-repo scripts AND for the shipped githooks.
#
# Sourced (not executed). Provides:
#
#   ensure_hooks_path     - Idempotently sets `core.hooksPath` to
#                           .io.v4rian.neo-git/githooks so the shipped
#                           hooks become active. Also installs the
#                           local `git v4r openPR` alias.
#                           Called by every in-repo script at startup.
#
#   ensure_repo_alias     - Idempotently installs `git v4r` as a local
#                           alias that dispatches to in-repo scripts:
#                             git v4r openPR  → scripts/open-pr.sh
#                             git v4r heal    → scripts/heal.sh
#                             git v4r verify  → scripts/verify-template.sh
#                           (renamed from the legacy `git repo` alias which
#                           collides with modern git's `repo` builtin)
#
#   claude_skill_run      - Runs a Claude skill via the `claude` CLI if
#                           installed, otherwise gracefully skips (logs
#                           a note but does not block). Returns 0 if
#                           audit passes or Claude unavailable; non-zero
#                           only on explicit AUDIT_FAIL from the skill.
#
#   claude_resolve_conflict - Invokes `claude -p` with working-tree
#                           file-edit permissions so claude can read
#                           conflict-markered files, apply semantic
#                           judgment per the git-reconcile-intent skill,
#                           and edit the files in place to clear the
#                           markers. Returns 0 when every passed-in file
#                           is conflict-marker-free after the call;
#                           non-zero when markers remain or claude is
#                           unavailable. Used by the L1-L5 ladder in
#                           auto-rebase-pools-after-dev-merge.sh.
#
#   claude_render_spec    - Invokes `claude -p` (read-only allowlist) with a
#                           system prompt that names the neo-git ticket spec
#                           (title shape, kind allowlist, body shape, bullet
#                           rules, em-dash ban, no fabricated JIRA codes) and
#                           a single operator-supplied natural-language
#                           description plus any prior operator answers to
#                           prior gap questions. Claude returns ONE of:
#                           (a) a JSON payload { title, body, kind, sprint? }
#                           on success; (b) one or more lines starting with
#                           QUESTION: when senior-engineer judgment detects
#                           gaps in the description that the spec cannot
#                           paper over. Returns 0 with the raw claude reply
#                           on stdout; non-zero on claude failure / missing
#                           CLI / parse failure. The caller composes the
#                           question loop (read operator answers, re-invoke)
#                           and the JSON parse. Test-mode bypass writes a

# Invoke claude to resolve cherry-pick conflict markers in the working

# allocation discipline with the right context for the tier. Claude is

# cleared and returns the outcome.

# Arguments:

#   $2 = full prompt body to pass on stdin to claude. Caller composes
#        this with: the active requirement, the tier-specific intent,

#        list of conflicting files, and the rule that claude must EDIT
#        the files in place (not print a patch) and emit either
#        RESOLVED on success or UNRESOLVED: <reason> on failure.
#   $3 = space-separated list of conflicting file paths (relative to

#     surface-only outcome); markers may still be present.

#   if the env var CLAUDE_RESOLVE_TEST_OUTCOME is set, that drives the
#   outcome (RESOLVED|UNRESOLVED|SURFACE). For RESOLVED the helper
#   strips conflict markers from each listed file by keeping the
#   "incoming" hunk between ======= and >>>>>>> (a deterministic
#   substitute for claude's judgment so the lifecycle suite can
#   exercise the ladder wiring without a network call). Default is

You are a senior engineer composing a JIRA ticket to v4rian/neo-git spec from an operator's casual natural-language description. The ticket will be filed via the jira CLI; sprint routing is the caller's job, not yours.

The neo-git ticket spec is the same spec git-commit-audit and git-strategy-audit enforce on commits and branches. Apply these rules verbatim:

Title:
  - Shape: [TAG] Subject in sentence case (no JIRA prefix; ingress fills the JIRA segment when needed).
  - Approved tags (case-sensitive): [FIX], [NEW], [REFACTOR], [DOCS], [TEST], [REVERT], [HOTFIX].
  - [NEW] only for genuinely new files / classes / integrations / subsystems / dependencies / operator workflows. Helper methods inside an existing class -> [REFACTOR]. Bug repair -> [FIX] or [HOTFIX].
  - Length: 8 to 72 chars total (including the tag).
  - Banned in title prose: em-dashes (the long horizontal dash), the literal word "plus", "and"/"with"/"+"/"," joiners that signal a non-atomic change. Hyphens in identifiers and English compounds are fine.

Body:
  - First a 1-3 sentence description paragraph at subsystem / class altitude. Title says WHAT; description says WHY and at WHAT SCOPE; bullets say HOW.
  - For [FIX] / [HOTFIX]: after the description, a "Cause:" paragraph then a "Fix:" paragraph then a "Changes:" block.
  - For every other tag: after the description, a "Changes:" block.
  - "Changes:" block format: nested bullets, top-level lists a class / module name (NOT a path), methods indent under the class. Verbs third-person present tense (Normalizes, Sends, Schedules). Never bullet fields / properties / vars / constants. Never fabricate symbol names.
  - Banned in body prose: em-dashes, the literal word "plus".
  - No "Co-Authored-By:" trailer.
  - Forbidden anywhere: BAK, bak import, historical import, recovered from, reconstructed, WIP snapshot, captured in, from the zip.

Kind (separate field from tag; used by the allocator):
  - Allowed values: feature, fix, refactor, r&d, doc.
  - Map [NEW] -> feature; [FIX] / [HOTFIX] -> fix; [REFACTOR] -> refactor; [DOCS] -> doc.
  - "r&d" only when the description describes exploration with no committed outcome (spike, prototype, investigation).

JIRA code:
  - Never invent a JIRA code. The ingress CLI handles filing; you only compose the ticket contents.

Reply contract (CRITICAL):
  You return EXACTLY ONE of the following two shapes on stdout, and nothing else:

  (A) On success, a single-line JSON object on its own line:
        {"title":"[TAG] Subject in sentence case","body":"Description paragraph.\\n\\nChanges:\\n  - ClassName\\n    - methodA does X.\\n    - methodB does Y.","kind":"feature"}
      The body MUST use \\n escape sequences (literal backslash-n in the JSON string) so it is a single line. The "kind" value MUST be one of: feature, fix, refactor, r&d, doc. Do not add explanatory text before or after.

  (B) On a gap that senior-engineer judgment cannot paper over from the description alone, ONE OR MORE lines each starting with the literal token "QUESTION:" followed by the gap question phrased to the operator. Example:
        QUESTION: which subsystem does "the parser" refer to here? Inline allocator parser, or the requirement-file parser?
        QUESTION: is this a bug repair (use [FIX]) or a new feature (use [NEW])?
      Surface questions ONLY when the description leaves a gap a senior engineer cannot reasonably infer. Do not invent gaps to look thorough.

Do NOT mix the two shapes. Do NOT add markdown fences, prefatory text, or trailing commentary. The caller parses your reply with a strict regex / json.load; extra text breaks it.

# Apply the git-commit-audit lens semantically to a single commit by

# the commit's subject, full message, and diff as the audit subject.
# The structural lens (atomicity surface, title regex, body shape,
# bullet style, file hygiene) already runs as deterministic shell
# checks elsewhere; this pass adds the judgment layer that catches:
#
#   - tag fit: [NEW] vs [FIX] vs [REFACTOR] boundary per the rules
#     in section B of the lens and feedback_tag_new_for_genuine_new_features
#   - fabrication: bullets naming methods/symbols that do not exist
#     in the committed tree (feedback_commit_no_fabrication)
#   - non atomic mixing: ≥2 unrelated concepts buried in one commit
#   - body vs diff contradiction: the body paragraph or bullets
#     describe behavior the diff does not implement
#
# Arguments:
#   $1 = commit SHA (must be reachable from the current repo)
#   $2 = path to the git-commit-audit SKILL.md file (the lens body)

# Returns:

#   No claude credential      same WARN-and-pass behavior. The helper
#                             accepts either CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN
#                             (the Max-plan OAuth token from `claude

#                             or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (the direct API key);
#                             both absent means the operator chose to

# Enumerate the open pool branches at this moment and emit one line per
# branch with the branch name, first commit date, and last commit date.
# Used by claim-main-release to append an "open work pool branches at
# release" section to the dev->main merge commit body so the release log
# carries an honest picture of what was still in flight when the cut went
# out.
#
# Output format (one branch per line, fields tab-separated):
#
#   <pool-ref-name>\t<first-commit-date>\t<last-commit-date>
#
# Dates are ISO 8601 short form (YYYY-MM-DD) via git log --format='%cs'.
# Order is ascending by first-commit-date so the oldest open branch is
# first and the most recently started is last, the natural "what's
# been waiting longest" reading order.
#
# Sourcing rules:
#   - Connected mode: read from refs/remotes/origin/pool/* so the view
#     reflects what the remote considers open right now. The script's
#     caller (claim-main-release.sh) has already pulled main, so origin
#     refs are fresh.
#   - Off-grid mode: read from refs/heads/pool/* since no remote view
#     applies. Local refs are the authority.
#
# Exclusions (NOT counted as "open work"):
#   - Reconcile sub-branches (.reconcile. in the name); those are the
#     transient rolling pointers produced by the auto-rebase ladder, not
#     developer-authored open work. See feedback_neo_git_never_rewrites_history.
#   - Branches whose tip is reachable from main (just landed; the merge
#     that triggered this release may have brought them in).
#
# First-commit-date resolution per branch:
#   1. If a paired safety/ ref exists (same nN, kind, slug, prefix), use
#      git log --reverse --format='%cs' safety..pool | sed -n 1p to get
#      the date of the first commit on the pool branch that the safety
#      anchor does not contain. This is the "first developer commit on
#      this allocation" date.
#   2. If no commits exist beyond the safety anchor (empty allocation),
#      fall back to the safety anchor's own committer date so the line
#      is still honest about the empty pool.
#   3. If no paired safety/ ref can be located (rare; manual branches
#      that bypassed the allocator), fall back to the date of the first
#      commit reachable from the pool ref not reachable from main;
#      conceptually the same intent, computed against a different
#      reference point.
#
# Last-commit-date per branch:
#   git log -1 --format='%cs' <pool-ref> for the tip's committer date.
#
# Arguments: none.
# Stdout: zero or more lines, one per open pool branch. Empty stdout when
# no branches are open (caller decides how to render that state).
# Always returns 0.
