#!/usr/bin/env bash
# build.sh - canonical single-source build script.
#
# Called by ci/audits/tag/required.build.sh (via build-retry.sh) on every
# v* tag push through ci-dispatch.yml's tag trigger, on admin re-build
# through build-on-tag.yml, and off grid through
# bin/ci-local --workflow build-on-tag. Consumer projects override this
# file in their fork with their actual build commands (npm run build,
# cmake --build, xcodebuild, cargo, etc.). The template ships a
# detector-based placeholder that DTRT for the common cases and prints
# a clear "consumer must override" banner for everything else.
#
# Output contract:
#   Place every artifact under ./build/artifacts/ at the repo root.
#   Files there are picked up by the tag build's post-build gates
#   and consumed unchanged by the (later) distribution bundle, which
#   attaches them as GitHub Release assets. The directory IS the API
#   between build and distribution. Do not write outside it; do not
#   nest a per-tag subdirectory (the tag is already the workflow run
#   label).
#
# Environment from the workflow:
#   $TAG                       tag name (e.g. v2026.0.7)
#   $BUILD_TYPE                always "release" on v* tag builds. The
#                              release ceremony reuses the dev tag's
#                              artifact at main promotion without a
#                              rebuild, so every tagged artifact is a
#                              release candidate: build in release
#                              configuration, with debug code, debug
#                              symbols, and debug builds excluded.
#                              Consumer overrides MUST honor this
#                              (-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release,
#                              NODE_ENV=production, cargo --release);
#                              the release artifact audit rejects
#                              debug-tainted output after the build.
#   $ARTIFACT_RETENTION_DAYS   age in days after which non-$TAG sibling
#                              artifacts move to build/artifacts/.trash/
#                              (recoverable, never deleted). Default 1;
#                              0 disables the sweep.
#   $BUILD_IDEMPOTENCY_CHECK   when set to 1, exit 0 if output for $TAG
#                              is already present at the contract path,
#                              non-zero otherwise. NO BUILDING happens in
#                              this mode (a pure presence probe).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  success (built, or in idempotency-check mode found existing output)
#   non-zero  build failed, or idempotency-check found no existing output

=========================================================================
build.sh has detected a CMakeLists.txt but the template ships no
generic Qt/C++ build recipe. Module set, generator, toolchain, and
artifact layout vary too much across consumers.

OVERRIDE build.sh with your project's build steps. Examples:

  cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  cmake --build build --parallel
  cp build/MyApp $ARTIFACT_DIR/MyApp-${TAG}

Output must land under ./$ARTIFACT_DIR/ for the distribution bundle to
find it. Filenames should embed \$TAG so the workflow idempotency check
can recognize a prior successful build. BUILD_TYPE is always "release"
here: configure Release (never Debug), and keep debug code, debug
symbols, and .dSYM bundles out of $ARTIFACT_DIR - the release artifact
audit rejects them.
