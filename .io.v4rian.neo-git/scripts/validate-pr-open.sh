# validate-pr-open.sh - canonical PR-open validator for the v4rian model.
#
# Invoked by .github/workflows/validate-pr-open.yml on every
# pull_request: [opened, edited, synchronize] event targeting dev or
# main. Same script handles both pool→dev and dev→main flows so the
# shielding, body amendment, and status-check posting all funnel
# through one place. Devs cannot evade by opening a PR a different
# way - the workflow re-runs server side and the dev branch ruleset
# requires the opened-via-correct-flow check before merge.
#
# Behavior in order:
#
#   1. Hard reject when the source branch shape is wrong for the
#      target. pool/* → dev and dev → main are the only legal pairs.
#      Anything else gets the PR closed via `gh pr close` with a
#      comment naming the rule violated.
#
#   2. Hard reject when the target is `main` AND the actor (PR author)
#      is not an admin on the repo. Releases are admin-only by design.
#      PRs into `dev` (the pool→dev path) are openable by any dev with
#      write access - the deeper enforcement on dev happens via the
#      server-side ruleset and the async audit-pushed-branch checks.
#
#   3. Scrub the PR body's characters (auto_fix_body from
#      scripts/lib/auto-fix-commit-message.sh), drop any legacy
#      signature comment, and gate it with check-merge-message.sh:
#      the body becomes the merge body, so it keeps the ruled shape
#      and nothing here prepends a tag, flattens the list or appends
#      a signature.
#
#   4. Post the opened-via-correct-flow status check on the PR head
#      commit. Green when all checks above passed; red when the PR
#      was closed for a rule violation.
#
# Step 3 also amends the PR title to the canonical merge-subject form
# so the GitHub UI's default merge subject (which the merger sees in
# the confirm-merge dialog) matches what the post-merge claim scripts
# will eventually stamp on the merge commit. Both bin/init-pool-merge
# and bin/init-release open the PR with a placeholder title and
# advertise to the caller that validate-pr-open completes the rename:
#
#   base=dev    [MERGE] <pool-branch> into dev: $(bin/version --next-dev)
#   base=main   [MERGE] dev into main: $(bin/version --release-tag)
#
# Without this amendment the placeholder title leaks into the merge
# commit when the merger uses the default subject (the dev-to-main
# defect previously observed under D-12). claim-dev-merge.sh and
# claim-main-release.sh still own the final merge-subject rewrite
# after the merge lands; this step keeps the open-PR view honest in
# the meantime.
#
# Env contract (all set by the workflow):
#
#   PR_NUMBER       - PR number (e.g. 42)
#   PR_HEAD_REF     - source branch (e.g. pool/n7.feature.foo)
#   PR_BASE_REF     - target branch (dev or main)
#   PR_HEAD_SHA     - head commit SHA the status check attaches to
#   PR_ACTOR        - PR author login
#   PR_BODY         - current body text
#   GH_TOKEN        - workflow token, scopes contents:read + pull-requests:write + statuses:write
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY - owner/repo
#   GITHUB_RUN_ID   - for signature embedding
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  - validation passed (PR amended where needed, status check green)
#   1  - validation failed for a recoverable reason; status check red, PR may stay open
#   2  - fatal: PR closed with comment because source/actor was illegal
#   3  - env contract violation (missing required input)
