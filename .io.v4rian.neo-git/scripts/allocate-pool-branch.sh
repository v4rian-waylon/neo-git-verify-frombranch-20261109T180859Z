# allocate-pool-branch.sh - canonical v4rian pool branch allocator.
#
# Single source of truth for atomic creation of a pool/nN.kind.* branch
# and its paired safety/nN.kind.* anchor. Invoked from:
#
#   - .github/workflows/allocate-pool-branch.yml (repository_dispatch
#     from JIRA Automation, or workflow_dispatch from a human admin)
#   - bin/create-pool-branch (local CLI wrapper: in connected mode it
#     triggers the workflow above via `gh workflow run`; in off-grid mode
#     it runs this script locally with ALLOC_MODE=off-grid)
#
# Behavior:
#
#   1. Parses inputs (kind, short_name, jira_key, sprint). kind is
#      optional; when absent it is classified via the Claude API from
#      the JIRA payload. short_name and jira_key are required.
#   2. Idempotency: scans existing pool/*, safety/*, vault/* refs for
#      the JIRA key (both flat and vYYYY.MAIN/-prefixed layouts). If
#      found, prints the existing branch URL on stdout (as JSON) and
#      exits 0 with no mutation.
#   3. Allocates the next nN as 1 + the highest number already spent,
#      across both layouts, so a number is never handed out twice. Spent
#      means any of: a pool/, safety/ or vault/ ref (local heads, plus the
#      remote-tracking refs of the remote dev tracks: branch.dev.remote,
#      else origin, else the only remote, with a notice whenever the
#      choice is not branch.dev.remote; other remotes are ignored, and
#      several remotes without origin count local refs only, said so on
#      stderr); a landing subject
#      "[MERGE] pool/.../nN. ..." anywhere in local branches, tags, that
#      remote and HEAD; an off-grid reservation refs/neo-git/allocated/nN.
#      Ids are contiguous within the active claim series (bin/version
#      --seal, vYYYY.S): a landing subject sealed ": vYYYY.S.D" in another
#      series is not counted, and preflight-bak* backup branches (local or
#      on the remote) land nothing, so their subjects are not counted.
#      Connected mode lists refs through the API and reads the
#      landing subjects from the workflow's full history checkout.
#      Off-grid only, before counting:
#        - refuses (exit 2) a shallow clone or a single-branch clone,
#          printing every repair in one message (`git fetch --unshallow`,
#          `git remote set-branches`);
#        - fetches the tracked remote under a watchdog that ends the
#          fetch process group after ALLOC_FETCH_TIMEOUT seconds (30 by
#          default; perl, present with git on every platform); when the
#          fetch fails or times out (or with --no-fetch) it still
#          allocates and prints how old its view is (last fetch, the
#          clone, or unknown), since another clone may have spent the
#          number;
#        - creates refs/neo-git/allocated/nN in the same update-ref
#          transaction as the pair, so two allocations racing in one
#          clone (lanes are worktrees sharing refs) never get the same
#          number: the loser recounts and retries, and a racer that
#          meets the winner's lock mid-commit waits up to
#          ALLOC_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS before retrying. Two separate clones
#          are serialized only by the fetch, so a window remains between
#          one clone's fetch and the other's push.
#      Reservations are names, not snapshots: each points at dev's root
#      commit, which dev keeps alive until a rewrite that changes the
#      root; then the reservation keeps that one old root (a few objects,
#      never a history) until it is pruned. They live outside refs/heads, so a normal push or fetch
#      never carries them, and the pre-push hook refuses any push that
#      would (explicit refspec or --mirror). After each off-grid
#      allocation, reservations below the highest number the tracked
#      remote or a local vault ref records are pruned.
#   4. Derives the vYYYY.MAIN major-version prefix from bin/version
#      --seal at allocation time (e.g. v2026.0.47 -> v2026.0) so the
#      same release-line classification that the vault and archived
#      safety paths carry applies from allocation onward. When the
#      seal is unreachable or unparseable, falls back to the legacy
#      flat layout for offline-test and bootstrap scenarios.
#   5. Composes the branch name as
#      pool/<vYYYY.MAIN>/nN.{kind}.[sprintX-]JIRA-NNN-{slug} (or the
#      legacy flat pool/nN.* when the prefix could not be derived),
#      then validates max ref length (255 chars).
#   6. Resolves current dev HEAD SHA via the Git Data API.
#   7. Creates pool/* and safety/* at that SHA atomically via POST
#      /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/refs. If safety creation fails after
#      pool was already created, the pool is deleted and the operation
#      reported as partial_pair_rollback.
#   8. Prints JSON {branch_name, safety_name, branch_url, safety_url,
#      sha, kind, jira_key, major_prefix} to stdout for caller
#      consumption.
#
# All claude classification requests use aggressive exponential backoff
# capped at 5 minutes between attempts; the workflow timeout (4320
# minutes) is the only ceiling. The expected real-world finish is
# seconds.
#
# Required environment:
#
#   GITHUB_REPOSITORY  owner/repo (auto-set in GitHub Actions; pass
#                      explicitly when running locally). REQUIRED in
#                      connected mode; IGNORED in off-grid mode.
#   GH_TOKEN           token with contents:write on the repo. REQUIRED
#                      in connected mode; IGNORED in off-grid mode.
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY  required only if kind classification is needed
#                      (kind input is empty)
#
# Required input env (or --flag form when invoked directly):
#
#   ALLOC_SHORT_NAME                      required
#   ALLOC_JIRA_KEY                        required UNLESS ALLOC_NO_JIRA=1
#                                         (or --no-jira). Both modes
#                                         (connected + off-grid) accept
#                                         the no-jira path; in connected
#                                         mode the workflow's admin gate
#                                         is the authorization.
#   ALLOC_NO_JIRA                         optional, set to "1" to omit
#                                         the JIRA segment from the branch
#                                         name. Idempotency-by-JIRA is
#                                         skipped when no JIRA key is
#                                         supplied. Works in both modes.
#   ALLOC_KIND                            optional (classified if absent)
#   ALLOC_SPRINT                          optional
#   ALLOC_JIRA_TITLE, ALLOC_JIRA_DESC     optional, used as classification
#                                         context when ALLOC_KIND is absent
#   ALLOC_MODE                            optional, "connected" (default)
#                                         or "off-grid". In off-grid mode
#                                         the allocator skips the GitHub
#                                         Git Data API entirely and creates
#                                         the pool+safety pair atomically
#                                         via `git update-ref --stdin` in
#                                         the local repo. The requirement
#                                         commit (when supplied) is built
#                                         via local git plumbing
#                                         (hash-object, mktree, commit-tree).
#                                         Off-grid replicates the connected
#                                         operator workflow exactly; only
#                                         the under-the-hood implementation
#                                         differs.
#   ALLOC_REQUIREMENT                     optional, the active-requirement
#                                         text for the branch (verbatim).
#                                         When supplied, the allocator
#                                         writes it to
#                                         .io.v4rian.neo-git/requirements/<pool ref, / as __>
#                                         and creates the initial [REQ]
#                                         commit on the pool branch with the
#                                         requirement text as the body. The
#                                         safety anchor stays at the dev
#                                         tip (no requirement commit) so it
#                                         remains the pristine fork point.
#   ALLOC_REQUIREMENT_FILE                optional, path to a file whose
#                                         content is the requirement text.
#                                         Overrides ALLOC_REQUIREMENT when
#                                         both are set.
#   ALLOC_FETCH_TIMEOUT                   optional, seconds before the
#                                         off-grid fetch is stopped and the
#                                         allocation goes offline (30).
#   ALLOC_LOCK_WAIT_SECONDS               optional, seconds an off-grid
#                                         allocation keeps retrying while
#                                         another git process holds a ref
#                                         lock it needs (default 20)
#   ALLOC_NO_FETCH                        optional, set to "1" (or pass
#                                         --no-fetch) to skip the off-grid
#                                         fetch of the tracked remote, for
#                                         an air-gapped clone; the

# Optional initial [REQ] active-requirement commit on the pool branch.
#
# When ALLOC_REQUIREMENT (or --requirement / --requirement-file) is set,
# the allocator writes the requirement text to a tracked file at
# .io.v4rian.neo-git/requirements/<lane key> and creates the initial commit on
# the pool branch with the requirement text as the body. The safety
# anchor stays at the dev tip (the pristine fork point); only the pool
# branch advances by one commit.
#
# This commit is the canonical "active requirement for this branch"
# document: auditors and the smart-commit tool fetch its body via
# .io.v4rian.neo-git/scripts/get-active-requirement.sh to give claude
# the branch's intent before it acts.
#
# Mechanics: blob -> tree (overlay of dev-tip tree + new file) -> commit
# (parent = dev tip) -> patch pool ref to the new commit SHA. The
# feedback_no_empty_commits rule is honored because the commit always
# touches a real file (the active-requirement file itself).
