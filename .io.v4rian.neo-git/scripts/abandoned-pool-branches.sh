#!/usr/bin/env bash
# abandoned-pool-branches.sh - enumerate pool branches that look abandoned.
#
# READ-ONLY institutional-memory reporter. Walks origin's pool/v*/n*.*
# refs (the v4rian Pattern-1 working-branch shape), classifies each one
# via _lib.sh::classify_pool_branch, and prints the candidates as either
# a markdown table or a JSON array. NEVER deletes anything; never
# mutates anything; never touches safety/, vault/, or main/dev refs.
# The operator reads the report and decides what to do with each branch.
#
# Per feedback_safety_anchors_stay_forever, safety anchors stay forever
# regardless of whether their paired pool branch was released, is in
# flight, or was abandoned. This reporter mirrors that policy: the
# safety anchor is the institutional record of where the pool was
# allocated, so the reporter uses the anchor's commit date as the
# canonical allocation timestamp but never proposes deleting it. Only
# the pool branch itself is the subject of any operator decision, and
# even then the decision (archive, hand off, drop) is the operator's
# alone - this script does not act.
#
# Excludes:
#   - Reconcile sub-branches (pool/v*/nN.reconcile.* and the older
#     pool/v*/nN.*.reconcile.* shape). Reconciles are auto-cut by the
#     auto-rebase ladder when dev advances under an open pool PR; they
#     are receipts of the rebase event, not original work. The original
#     branch carries the abandonment signal; the reconcile is downstream.
#   - Pool tips reachable from origin/main (already released).
#   - Pool branches with at least one merged PR (semantically shipped
#     even when the squash-merged SHA is no longer reachable).
#   - Branches already vaulted on origin (vault/* refs are scanned and
#     their suffix is matched against the pool name; a vaulted pool
#     never appears in the report).
#
# Output modes:
#   --table (default)  human-readable markdown table.
#   --json             JSON array of objects with the same fields.
#
# Other flags:
#   --days N           abandonment threshold in days; default 30. A pool
#                      with a more recent commit than N days is classified
#                      as "fresh" and excluded.
#   --include-non-candidate
#                      include "fresh", "active", and "merged" rows in the
#                      output so the operator can see why each branch was
#                      excluded. Useful for diagnosing classification
#                      decisions; the default is candidates only because
#                      the report is meant to drive follow-up, not audit.
#   --repo OWNER/REPO  override the auto-resolved owner/repo (default:
#                      derived from `git config --get remote.origin.url`).
#   -h | --help        show this header and exit.
#
# Usage:
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/bin/abandoned-pool-branches
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/bin/abandoned-pool-branches --days 7
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/bin/abandoned-pool-branches --json
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/bin/abandoned-pool-branches --json --days 90
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  report emitted successfully (regardless of whether any candidates
#      were found; an empty report is a healthy state, not a failure).
#   2  bad CLI input.
#   3  missing dependency (gh required for PR state lookups).
