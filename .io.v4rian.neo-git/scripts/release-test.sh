#!/usr/bin/env bash
# release-test.sh - run and portability surface for the tag build's artifacts.
#
# The last gate of the tag build: proves the compiled release artifacts RUN
# as intended before they sit in the distribution path (the release ceremony
# reuses them at main promotion without a rebuild). Consumer projects
# override this file with their real launch/smoke assertions - start the
# binary, hit its /version endpoint, open the bundle, run the CLI with
# --help - the same way they override build.sh with their real build. The
# template ships a detector-based placeholder that DTRT for the common
# cases and prints a clear "consumer must override" banner for everything
# else.
#
# Portability: the placeholder reports each artifact's file type, and for
# Mach-O payloads the minimum-OS floor of every slice it can see (one
# minos-26 dylib gates a whole bundle to macOS 26 regardless of the app
# binary's stamp). The report is the surface; consumer overrides turn the
# lines that matter into hard assertions for their platform matrix.
#
# Environment (same contract as build.sh):
#   $TAG           tag under test (e.g. v2026.0.7)
#   $BUILD_TYPE    always "release" on v* tag builds
#   $ARTIFACT_DIR  artifact contract path (default build/artifacts)
#
# Exit codes: 0 artifacts run as intended, 1 a run test failed or an
# override obligation is unmet, 2 usage/pipeline.

=========================================================================
release-test.sh has no generic run recipe for this artifact set. Launch
commands, smoke endpoints, and platform assertions vary too much across
consumers.

OVERRIDE release-test.sh with your project's run tests. Examples:

  ./build/artifacts/MyApp-\$TAG --version | grep -q "\$TAG"
  open build/artifacts/MyApp.app && curl -sf localhost:8080/version
  node dist/main.js --smoke

Every artifact under \$ARTIFACT_DIR should be exercised; exit non-zero
when any artifact fails to run as intended. Use the portability report
above to pin your platform floor (e.g. assert every Mach-O is minos 12).
