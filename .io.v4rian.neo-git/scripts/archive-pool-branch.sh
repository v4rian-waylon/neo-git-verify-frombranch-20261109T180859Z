#!/usr/bin/env bash
# archive-pool-branch.sh - rename a pool/* branch into vault/vYYYY.MAIN/<suffix>
# on origin (with a flat vault/<suffix> fallback for legacy/test repos).
#
# Idempotent. Used by claim-dev-merge.sh after a successful merge so the
# pool branch never gets DELETED - its content is preserved under
# vault/vYYYY.MAIN/<suffix>, out of sight but recoverable forever. Pool
# branches represent historical work-in-progress snapshots and per the
# v4rian discipline must never be lost.
#
# The vYYYY.MAIN/ prefix groups all vaults that belong to the same major
# release cycle (year + main-counter), so a glance at refs/heads/vault/
# reveals "which nN branches landed in this release cycle." The prefix is
# derived from bin/version --seal at archive time by trimming the trailing
# .DEV segment: v2026.0.39 → v2026.0. If bin/version is unreachable or
# returns an unparseable value, the script falls back to a flat
# vault/<suffix> path (legacy + offline-test scenarios).
#
# Behavior:
#   - If a prefixed vault/<MAJOR>/<suffix> OR a legacy flat vault/<suffix>
#     already exists on origin, ensure pool/<suffix> is removed and exit
#     successfully (re-runs are no-ops; the legacy match prevents this
#     script from duplicating a vault that an older claim already made).
#   - If pool/<suffix> does not exist on origin, nothing to archive; exit 0.
#   - Otherwise: push the pool's SHA to the prefixed vault path, then
#     delete the pool/<suffix> ref on origin.
#
# This script NEVER touches branches that don't start with `pool/`.
#
# Usage:
#   archive-pool-branch.sh pool/nN.kind.short_name
#   archive-pool-branch.sh --dry-run pool/nN.kind.short_name
#   archive-pool-branch.sh -h | --help
