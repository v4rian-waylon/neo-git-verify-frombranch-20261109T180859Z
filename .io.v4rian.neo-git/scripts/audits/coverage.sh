# audits/coverage.sh - deterministic test-coverage verification for the
# pushed branch. Run by the sys-layer
# ci/audits/push/required.coverage.sh check of ci-dispatch.yml's push trigger
# (on demand: audit-pushed-branch.yml; off grid: bin/ci-local).
#
# Consumer projects override this script with their actual coverage
# recipe (jest --coverage, vitest run --coverage, the project's own
# fenrir-style harness, etc.). The template ships a placeholder that
# defers to the consumer when build artifacts are detected and otherwise
# treats the run as a no-op.
#
# Contract:
#   - Exit 0 when coverage meets the project's threshold, or N/A when no
#     recognised project type is present (an "N/A coverage" line says so).
#   - Exit non-zero when the configured threshold is not met, with the
#     failing report surfaced in the workflow log.
