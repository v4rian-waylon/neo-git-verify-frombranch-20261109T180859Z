#!/usr/bin/env bash
# commit-audit.sh — push-trigger audit that runs the git-commit-audit
# lens against every commit landed by the current push.
#
# The lens lives at .io.v4rian.neo-git/skills/git-commit-audit/SKILL.md
# and covers atomicity, title format, body shape, bullet style,
# fabrication detection, file hygiene, branching, and merge format.
# In the real (non-test) path, semantic judgment runs through
# claude_judge_commit_range (see scripts/_lib.sh) which invokes
# `claude -p` EXACTLY ONCE for the WHOLE push range — one process for
# N commits, not one per commit — with the SKILL.md body as the system
# context and the full per-commit triple for every SHA, then parses one
# AUDIT_PASS / AUDIT_FAIL verdict line per commit from the reply. The
# per-commit judgment is preserved verbatim (same lens, same per-commit
# verdicts); only the process count drops from N to 1. This adds the
# judgment layer that catches tag fit (e.g. [NEW] vs [REFACTOR]
# boundary), fabrication of method or symbol names in bullets, non
# atomic mixing, and body-versus-diff contradiction, failures the
# deterministic structural lens by itself cannot detect.
#
# Under LIFECYCLE_TEST_MODE the helper short-circuits to a canned
# outcome so the offline lifecycle suite exercises the wiring
# without a network round trip or API spend. When the `claude` CLI
# is unavailable, or when neither CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN (preferred,
# Max-plan OAuth) nor ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (direct API key) is set, the
# helper emits a visible WARN banner on stderr and returns 0 so a
# missing credential never red-checks a push; the structural lens
# that runs alongside this audit stays the hard gate.
#
# Push-range resolution order:
#
#   1. GITHUB_EVENT_BEFORE + GITHUB_EVENT_AFTER (set by the workflow
#      from github.event.before / github.event.after). When BEFORE
#      is the zero-SHA (a brand-new branch push), the range falls
#      back to merge-base with origin/dev.
#   2. When the env pair is absent (local invocation, dry-run), the
#      range walks every commit reachable from HEAD that is NOT
#      reachable from origin/dev. This is the "branch's own commits"
#      definition the auto-rebase ladder already uses.
#
# Exit code propagation:
#
#   0 — every commit in range passed the lens (or the range is
#       empty, e.g. a push that only moves an existing tip with no
#       new commits).
#   1 — at least one commit failed the lens. The script prints the
#       offending commit SHAs and the lens-reported reason to stderr
#       so the CI log surfaces the specific failures.
#   2 — usage / environment error (missing git repo, missing skill).
#
# Env knobs:
#
#   LIFECYCLE_TEST_MODE=1   bypass real claude for the per-commit lens
#                           pass; the deterministic em-dash gate runs
#                           regardless of this knob because it costs
#                           nothing and is the only defence-in-depth
#                           against a missed or bypassed pre-commit
#                           scrub.
#   COMMIT_AUDIT_DRY_RUN=1  print the planned per-commit invocations
#                           but do not call claude; useful for local
#                           preview without spending API budget.

# Defence-in-depth em-dash gate. The pre-commit hook scrubs em-dashes
# (U+2014) and en-dashes (U+2013) from staged files before the commit
# lands; this gate catches the case where the hook was bypassed (e.g.
# `git commit --no-verify`, a broken hook, or a commit landed via the
# GitHub web UI) and the offending bytes slipped into the push range.
#
# The gate walks every SHA in the resolved range, runs
# `git show --no-color --no-renames` to inspect the unified diff,
# tracks the current file via `+++ b/<path>` headers, and inspects
# every added line (`^+`, but not the `+++` header) for the U+2014 or
# U+2013 byte sequences. Hits accumulate a failure count and report
# the offending SHA, file, and line; an empty range or a range that
# only touches opt-out files returns success. Implemented in pure
# bash/grep so it adds no runtime dependency beyond what the surrounding
# script already requires.
