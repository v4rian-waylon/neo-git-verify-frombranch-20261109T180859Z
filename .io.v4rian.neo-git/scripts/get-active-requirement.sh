# get-active-requirement.sh — fetch the active-requirement document for a
# pool/* branch.
#
# Auditors and the smart-commit tool call this script when they invoke
# claude on behalf of work happening on a pool branch. The output is the
# verbatim requirement text the allocator stamped on the branch at
# creation time. Claude reads that text and treats it as the canonical
# intent for the branch.
#
# Sources, in order (the first non-empty one wins):
#
#   1. The lane's own file .io.v4rian.neo-git/requirements/<key> at the
#      branch tip, where <key> is the branch name with "/" as "__"
#      (hg_requirement_path in _lib.sh). One path per lane, so parallel
#      lanes never collide on it and a lane that merges dev still reads
#      its own.
#
#   2. The first [REQ] commit on the pool branch reachable from the
#      branch tip but not from origin/dev (the allocator's initial
#      commit by construction): the requirements file it added, read at
#      the tip (so a SHA or a detached HEAD gets the verbatim text too),
#      else its body for legacy lanes.
#
#   3. Legacy: the single shared .io.v4rian.neo-git/active-requirement
#      file that allocators before the per-lane layout wrote. Read last
#      because after a merge it can carry another lane's text.
#
# Behaviour:
#
#   - Prints the requirement text on stdout, no trailing decoration,
#     no banners. Suitable for piping straight into a claude prompt
#     template.
#   - Exits 0 when a requirement was found.
#   - Exits 0 with empty stdout when the branch has no requirement
#     attached (legacy branches that predate this step, or branches
#     allocated without --requirement). The caller decides whether
#     to proceed without context or to surface the absence.
#   - Exits 2 only on a usage error (missing/invalid branch arg).
#
# Usage:
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/scripts/get-active-requirement.sh <pool-branch>
#
# Examples:
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/scripts/get-active-requirement.sh pool/n51.feature.PROJ-7-parser
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/scripts/get-active-requirement.sh HEAD
#   REQ=$(.io.v4rian.neo-git/scripts/get-active-requirement.sh "$BRANCH")
#   claude -p "Active requirement: $REQ"$'\n\n'"...rest of prompt..."
