# auto-rebase-pools-after-dev-merge.sh: produce a reconcile candidate for
# every active pool/* PR after a successful dev merge claim. The script
# NEVER mutates a developer's pool branch and NEVER closes the original
# PR - automation only UPDATES existing PRs and, for a CLEAN replay of an
# already-legitimated PR, OPENS one cross-linked reconcile PR. The
# developer is sovereign in their pool/* sandbox, but sovereignty cannot
# halt the project: a successful pass links the reconcile candidate on the
# existing PR (recap comment with the quick create link plus the reconcile
# commit status) so the admin can integrate the reconciled work without
# waiting for the developer. Only the admin decides what lands on dev via
# review.
#
# Inherit-status and cross-linked-PR behavior (supersedes the prior
# "never opens a PR" line for the CLEAN-and-legitimated case; the
# conflict/L1-L5 case still never opens a PR):
#   - LEGITIMATED-PR GATE: a PR is reconciled with inheritance ONLY when
#     all 5 required.* checks were already success on its ORIGINAL head
#     SHA before the dev merge (required.commit-audit, required.compile,
#     required.coverage, required.runtime, required.offline-test-suites).
#     If any of the 5 is not success the PR was not legitimated: the pass
#     keeps today's comment-only behavior and logs "not previously green;
#     reconcile candidate left for manual review". No inherit, no PR-open.
#   - INHERIT (CLEAN replay only): a clean cherry-pick with zero conflict
#     edits is byte-identical content to what already passed those checks,
#     so the bot POSTs each of the 5 required.* statuses as success onto
#     the reconcile candidate SHA - inheriting a known-true result with no
#     CI re-run, no workflow triggering, no App, no human. The bot posted
#     them, so vault-provenance passes. The conflict/L1-L5 path NEVER
#     inherits: conflict-resolved commits changed content and must be
#     audited for real.
#   - CROSS-LINKED PR (CLEAN and legitimated only): the pass opens one
#     real reconcile->dev PR whose head is the reconcile branch and whose
#     body cross-references the original PR number (so GitHub auto-creates
#     a timeline cross-reference) and states the original is kept as the
#     record. Idempotent: a second pass does not open a duplicate; it
#     refreshes the existing reconcile PR's body. A one-line cross-link
#     comment then lands on the ORIGINAL PR. The original PR stays open
#     and untouched (the record).
#
# Triggered from claim-dev-merge.sh after the post-claim tag + push.
# For each open PR whose head branch matches the pool/* shape:
#
#   1. Update the PR title's aspirational version prefix to the version
#      it would actually claim if merged next. This is a metadata edit
#      only - it does not touch the pool branch or the PR's open state.
#   2. Cut `pool/nN.reconcile.<short>` off the new dev tip (same nN as
#      the original pool, kind=reconcile, short=original short). The
#      canonical reconcile name stays clean across every pass: no -2 /
#      -3 / -<sha> enumeration ever appears on it. A reconcile candidate
#      is machine-owned, freely rewritable state - NOT developer history.
#      Each pass rebuilds it from scratch against the new dev tip (step 3)
#      and FORCE-PUSHES it onto the canonical name: a rolling pointer that
#      repoints in place. No delete, no rename, no tmp slot. A
#      non-fast-forward update of a pool/*.reconcile.* ref is permitted for
#      the plain workflow token (pool-creations carves reconcile out,
#      pool-deletions never fires on an update, and the no-force rule binds
#      only the DEVELOPER's pool branch). The developer's pool/* branch is
#      still NEVER force-pushed - see feedback_neo_git_never_rewrites_history.
#   2a. Post a START-of-reconcile comment on the existing PR BEFORE any
#       cherry-pick attempt so the admin / developer has live visibility
#       into the in-flight pass. The end-of-pass comment (step 4b / 5)
#       still lands at the end; this additive start comment is what gives
#       the PR a two-comment timeline per reconcile attempt instead of
#       just an end-only signal.
#   3. Cherry-pick the pool branch's commits (OLD_BASE..OLD_TIP) onto
#      the reconcile branch one at a time. On any cherry-pick conflict,
#      escalate through the L1-L5 ladder via claude_skill_run to attempt
#      smart resolution. The original pool branch is read-only here.
#   4. All commits cherry-picked successfully (clean or with claude help):
#        a. Force-push the reconcile branch onto the canonical name. The
#           candidate ref carries no CI of its own (a workflow-token push
#           never re-triggers ci-dispatch); it is validated by dev's
#           required checks when the admin merges it.
#        b. Comment on the existing PR with the recap directed at the
#           admin: dev advanced to <sha>, reconcile candidate is
#           `pool/nN.reconcile.<short>`, conflicts resolved as follows.
#        c. Do NOT close the original PR. Do NOT open a new PR. Do NOT
#           push to the original pool branch. The recap comment carries
#           the candidate and its quick create link; the original PR is
#           the developer's record and automation only updates it.
#   5. Some commits unresolvable after L5: push the partial reconcile
#      state for review, comment on the original PR with the unresolved
#      file list plus the full L1-L5 attempt log. The PR stays open;
#      the developer or admin picks up from the partial state.
#   6. Iterative: if dev advances again before either party acts, the
#      next auto-rebase pass rebuilds the canonical reconcile name from
#      scratch against the newest dev tip and force-pushes it (step 2).
#      Prior attempts are not retained as numbered receipts; the canonical
#      ref always carries the most-recent candidate. Receipts of every
#      reconcile attempt still live in the PR's comment timeline (start +
#      end comment pair per pass).
#
# The dev's window of action is organic, not turn-taking: they own the
# pool branch and can push their own resolution at any time. If they
# push a clean state before the admin reviews, the reconcile candidate
# is moot and stays as a receipt only. If the admin reviews first and
# acts on the reconcile, a slow dev's in-progress work becomes wasted
# time. The system gives no protection for slowness; admin's review is
# the gate (see feedback_neo_git_never_rewrites_history).
