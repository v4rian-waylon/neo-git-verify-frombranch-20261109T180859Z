# required.build.sh - tag gate: builds the v* tag's release artifacts and
# proves they ship clean and run.
#
# Usage:
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/ci/audits/tag/required.build.sh            run the gate
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/ci/audits/tag/required.build.sh -h|--help
# No arguments. TAG defaults to GITHUB_REF_NAME (the v* tag on the
# ci-dispatch tag trigger); set TAG to run it by hand.
#
# Steps, in one job because build/artifacts/ exists only in this workspace:
#   1. scripts/workflows/build-retry.sh runs scripts/build.sh in an
#      eight-attempt backoff envelope; output lands in build/artifacts/.
#      BUILD_IDEMPOTENCY_CHECK=1 short-circuits an already-built tag.
#   2. scripts/workflows/release-artifact-audit.sh refuses debug output
#      (*.dSYM, *.pdb, *.debug, -debug/_debug names, *.map next to .js,
#      debugger; statements), plus a claude judgment layer that WARNs when
#      claude is unavailable.
#   3. scripts/release-test.sh proves the artifacts run (consumers override
#      it with their launch or --help smoke) and reports Mach-O minos floors.
# Distribution (GitHub Release, promotion) is not this gate's job. Same code
# is the same version and the same artifact: built once at the dev tag and
# reused at main promotion without a rebuild.
#
# Environment: GITHUB_TOKEN with contents:read is enough.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  built, audited clean, run test passed
#   1  a helper script is missing, or a step failed (the failing step's own
#      exit code is propagated)
