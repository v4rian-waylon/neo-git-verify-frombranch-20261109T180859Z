#!/usr/bin/env bash
# required.claim.sh (pr-merge-dev) - claims a pool/* merge into dev.
#
# MUTATES THE REMOTE: run only from the CI trigger after a pool/* PR merged
# into dev, or by an admin repeating a failed claim. Never as a probe.
#
# Usage:
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/ci/audits/pr-merge-dev/required.claim.sh   run the claim
#   .io.v4rian.neo-git/ci/audits/pr-merge-dev/required.claim.sh -h|--help
#
# What it does (scripts/claim-dev-merge.sh): amends the merge commit subject
# and body into the spec shape, force-pushes dev with lease keeping the
# merger's identity, tags the merge SHA with the next bin/version --seal and
# archives the merged pool/* branch to vault/<vYYYY.MAIN>/<suffix>.
#
# Environment (set by ci-dispatch.yml): CI_TRIGGER, CI_LAYER=sys,
# CI_KIND=audits, CI_CHECK_NAME=required.claim, and a GITHUB_TOKEN with
# contents:write for the force-push and tag push. A consumer shadows this
# script by shipping its own usr-layer ci/audits/pr-merge-dev/claim.sh.
#
# Retry: delegates to scripts/workflows/claim-retry.sh --target dev, which
# retries with 5 s doubling backoff capped at 300 s, MAX_ATTEMPTS (default
# 8). The claim is idempotent (an existing tag is never re-created), so
# every attempt is safe.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  claimed (or already claimed)
#   1  claim-retry.sh is missing
#   2  the claim script is missing
#   N  the claim's own exit code after the last failed attempt
