# Git Strategy

A minimal, production-safe branching model built around stability, traceability,
parallel development, and **atomic version claiming on PR merge**.

---

## Branch Structure

```
main
└── dev
    └── pool/nN.{feature|fix|r&d|refactor|reconcile|doc}.[sprintX-][JIRA-]short-name

# (safety/ branches are permanent pre-merge snapshots, never deleted - see Safety Branches)
```

## Release Flow

1. Working branch (`pool/nN...`) → PR → `dev` (via `--no-ff`)
   - Post-merge hook fires `claim-dev-merge.sh`
   - `bin/version --seal` computes `vYEAR.SERIES.DEV` (from merge counts)
   - Annotated tag created on the merge commit; pushed to origin
   - (No commit written on dev - tags are the seal, no chore-version commit)
2. Stabilize in `dev`
3. PR `dev` → `main` (via `--no-ff`, REQUIRED for merge countability)
   - Post-merge hook fires `claim-main-release.sh`
   - Release REUSES the existing dev tag (same code = same version)
   - GitHub Release object created/attached to that tag via `gh release create`
   - `ci-dispatch.yml`'s tag trigger ships the built artifact to internal + public channels
   - The artifact was already gated at its tag build: release-type compile
     (`BUILD_TYPE=release`), the no-debug artifact audit, and the release
     run test - promotion reuses it without a rebuild, so nothing
     debug-tainted or non-running ever reaches the public channel
4. Deploy

## Stability Model

| Branch         | Deploy | CI Required             | Lifetime  |
|----------------|--------|-------------------------|-----------|
| `main`         | Yes    | Yes                     | Permanent |
| `dev`          | No     | Yes                     | Permanent |
| `pool/nN.…`     | No     | Encouraged              | Temporary |
| `safety/nN.…`  | No     | N/A (read-only snapshot)| Permanent |

### `main` - Production

- Always stable and deployable
- No direct commits
- Only merges from `dev` via PR
- Merge commit IS the released version
- **Every dev→main merge produces a GitHub Release** (e.g., `v2026.0.5`) - reusing the existing dev tag, not creating a new one

### `dev` - Integration / Nightly

- Integration branch for completed work
- Weekly builds
- No direct commits
- PR required with CI passing (tests, build)
- **Every merge produces a version tag; tags are internal and never promoted to public releases**

### Working branches - `pool/nN.…`

- Format: `pool/nN.(feature|fix|r&d|refactor|reconcile|doc).[sprintX-][JIRA-]short-name`
- `nN` is a **creation sequence number** allocated by the repo's
  branch-creation endpoint - atomic on the server, no collisions. Off
  grid the local allocator never reissues a number it can see (RUNBOOK
  "Off-grid allocation" states what it sees and the window between two
  separate clones)
- **Created via the repo's branch-creation endpoint** (see Branch
  Creation below), not directly by developers
- Merged back via PR into `dev`
- Deleted after merge
- **One unit of work = one pool branch, for its whole life.** When a
  gate rejects the branch (red CI check, failed commit audit, broken
  content), the correction lands as further commits ON THE SAME pool
  branch and the same PR updates itself. Allocation mints branches for
  NEW units of work only; requesting a fresh `nN` to retry the same
  attempted fix, or closing the PR to supersede it with a sibling
  branch, is a workflow violation - suffixed sibling names
  (`short-name-2`, `short-name-3`) never appear. A defect in already
  pushed history (a commit message that fails the lens) is corrected by
  the branch's own developer amending in place and pushing with
  `--force-with-lease` to the SAME ref before merge; the no rewrite
  principle protects merged history, vaults, and other actors'
  branches, not the developer's own unmerged sandbox. The developer
  owns the branch until the admin merges or rejects the PR.
- **Developers NEVER delete branches** - not their own, never someone
  else's. A pool branch is an isolated, sandboxed dropbox of organized,
  neat, clean, tested work that the neo-git workshop does NOT trust and
  retests through its own gates. Devs commit to it and may rewrite
  their own unmerged history in place; deletion belongs exclusively to
  the workshop (the claim archive under the CI lifecycle identity) and
  to admins. The pool-deletions ruleset enforces this server side
  across every pool ref, reconcile candidates included; the creation
  lock carves out the `pool/*.reconcile.*` name shape so the CI claim
  publishes candidates with its plain token, and vault refs freeze the
  instant they exist so the claim vaults the same way. The dev contract
  reduces to one sentence: commit history to your allocated branch and
  push it - nothing else.

The trailing short-name has three parts:

| Segment              | Required | Format                | Notes                              |
|----------------------|----------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| `sprintX-`           | Optional | `sprint` + integer    | Sprint context, e.g. `sprint4-`    |
| `JIRA-`              | Optional | `PROJ-NNN-`           | Uppercase project key + ticket ID  |
| `short-name` | Required | `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]*` | Hyphens only; lowercase  |

Examples:
- `pool/n3.feature.parser-rewrite`
- `pool/n3.feature.sprint4-parser-rewrite`
- `pool/n7.fix.PROJ-123-token-leak`
- `pool/n12.r&d.sprint5-PROJ-456-embedding-cache`
- `pool/n4.refactor.config-module`

### Safety Branches - Immutable Work Anchors

Each `pool/` branch has a paired `safety/` branch created **at the same
moment, atomically**, by the branch-creation endpoint. Safety is the
immutable record of where the work began - the anchor that survives
even if the working branch is force-pushed, accidentally deleted, or
otherwise destroyed.

- Format: `safety/nN.kind.short-name` - **identical to the paired dev
  branch after the scope prefix**
- Both branches point at the same commit at creation time (current
  `dev` HEAD)
- Created **atomically** with the dev branch; if either creation fails,
  the endpoint rolls back and the caller is told (see Branch Creation)
- **Read-only** - no commits land on safety, no PRs target it, no
  force-pushes
- Lifetime: **permanent.** Once created, a `safety/…` branch persists
  for the life of the repo and is **never deleted** - not at the
  `dev → main` release that seals the paired work, not ever. The
  ruleset (`rulesets/safety-lockdown.json`) locks every `safety/…` ref
  fully, and no claim or release script enumerates safety branches for
  deletion.
- **Why permanent.** Whether the paired `pool/…` branch merges or is
  abandoned (work dropped, R&D dead end, redirected), the safety branch
  stays. Merged anchors document exactly what landed; abandoned
  exploration often becomes valuable reference material later. The
  safety branch is the cheapest possible institutional memory of "what
  was tried." Cost is near-zero; intent is preservation.

- **Snapshots are not anchors.** Hand-taken or tool-taken snapshots
  named `safety/<branch>-<timestamp>` (Pattern-2, for example the
  preflight `bin/sync-pools` takes) are local recovery points, not
  allocation records. Once the snapshot's tip is merged into dev and
  its pool is vaulted, `bin/gc-safety --apply` moves them into a
  verified bundle under `~/.Trash/git-branch-trash/` before deleting
  the refs. The permanent rule above covers every Pattern-1 anchor.

What safety protects against:

- The working branch is force-pushed or rebased into an unrecoverable
  state → `safety/…` still holds the anchor commit
- The working branch is accidentally deleted before merge → `safety/…`
  proves what was branched from
- A merge into `dev` is later determined to be defective → the diff
  between `safety/…` and the merge commit is a clean audit record of
  exactly what changed

Safety branches are about eliminating the **single point of failure**
that a sole working branch represents - without them, a force-push or
delete is unrecoverable without reflog archaeology.

`main` is protected separately by its tag history - every prior release
tag is itself a rollback target, so no safety branch is created on
`dev → main` merges by default.

### Branch Creation

Developers **do not create branches on the remote**. New `pool/` branches
(and their paired `safety/` branches) are provisioned by a
**synchronous branch-creation endpoint owned by the repository**. The
endpoint encapsulates all `nN` allocation logic and is the only non-CI
identity the server's branch-creation restriction trusts.

The endpoint accepts a request specifying:

- Kind (`feature` / `fix` / `r&d` / `refactor`)
- Optional sprint number
- Optional JIRA ticket reference
- Short descriptive name (slug)

On invocation it:

1. Atomically allocates the next available `nN`
2. **Atomically creates both branches** from current `dev` HEAD:
   - `pool/nN.kind.…` (the working branch)
   - `safety/nN.kind.…` (the immutable anchor)
3. Returns **synchronously** with the new branch name on success, or a
   structured error on failure

**Synchronous-with-confirmation is required** - if branch creation
fails (allocator down, permission issue, transient git error, partial
pair creation), the caller must know immediately. A dev who's been
told "your branch is ready" only to find nothing there has no recovery
path; the failure must surface at the moment of request.

If creating the pair partially fails (e.g. `pool/…` succeeds but
`safety/…` fails), the endpoint **rolls back the partial state** - the
operation is all-or-nothing.

Off-grid, the same allocator runs locally (`bin/create-pool-branch`
with `MODE` set to `off-grid`) and plays the endpoint's role with one
`git update-ref --stdin` transaction; see RUNBOOK "Off-grid allocation".

Callers of the endpoint include:

- **JIRA** - triggers a request when a task enters the active sprint;
  surfaces the success/error in the ticket
- **CLI** (e.g., `create-pool-branch`) - for spikes, admin actions, or
  workflows outside JIRA; dispatches the in-repo allocator workflow and
  watches the resulting run
- **Other automations** - security advisories, scheduled refactor work,
  etc.

JIRA is one consumer, not the source of truth. **The repo owns branch
naming and number allocation regardless of who is asking.** This keeps
the scheme portable: replacing JIRA with another tracker, or running
without a tracker at all, requires no change to the allocator.

Implementation: a GitHub App (or equivalent on other forges) with
`contents:write` scope. The synchronous contract is most easily met by
exposing the App as an HTTP endpoint backed by a short-lived
workflow_dispatch, or by using a small custom service. Repository Rules
restrict everyone else from creating branches matching `pool/*` or
`safety/*`, so the App is the only viable path to a remote branch.

Developers may create branches **locally** for spikes; the `pre-push`
hook refuses to push a misnamed branch, and in connected mode the
server-side restriction rejects creating a `pool/*` or `safety/*` remote
branch from a developer identity (no server rule checks names). Pushing commits to an
existing remote branch is unrestricted.

## Versioning

Three-segment format, derived deterministically from git merge counts:

```
v{YYYY}.{SERIES}.{DEV}
```

- `YYYY` - 4-digit year, derived from the calendar at compute time
- `SERIES` - count of main merges this year (on main's first-parent line). Increments implicitly on every dev → main release merge. Resets on year rollover. Nothing is manually bumped.
- `DEV` - count of dev merges in the current cycle (since the last main merge, or since year start if no main release has happened yet). In cycle 0 (`SERIES == 0`) the count is 1-indexed because there is no `v.0.0` anchor; in cycle 1+ the count is 0-indexed because the main release itself acts as the `v.X.0` anchor.

**Same code = same version.** Every value is derived deterministically by counting first-parent merges. A pool→dev merge tags the merge commit with `vYYYY.SERIES.(NEXT_DEV)` where `NEXT_DEV = count + 1` in cycle 0 or `NEXT_DEV = count` in cycle 1+. When that work later flows to main via `dev → main --no-ff`, the release REUSES the same tag - no new git tag is created, just a GitHub Release object attached to the existing tag. Two binary-identical builds never carry different versions.

Examples:

```
v2026.0.1    ← first pool→dev merge of 2026 (cycle 0, 1-indexed start)
v2026.0.2    ← second pool→dev merge
v2026.0.7    ← seventh pool→dev merge
              dev → main release happens - REUSES v2026.0.7. SERIES bumps
              to 1 implicitly because main merge count incremented.
v2026.1.0    ← first pool→dev merge after the release (cycle 1, 0-indexed
              start because v2026.1.0 is the anchored start of cycle 1)
v2026.1.1    ← next pool→dev merge in cycle 1
v2027.0.0    ← first state of 2027 (year rollover; clean reset)
```

### Component sources

| Component | Source                                                                                  | When it changes |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `YYYY`    | `date -u +%Y` at compute time                                                           | Year rollover (Jan 1 UTC) |
| `SERIES`  | `git log main --first-parent --merges --since=YYYY-01-01 \| wc -l`                       | Every dev → main release merge |
| `DEV`     | `git log dev --first-parent --merges --since=YYYY-01-01 [--not main] \| wc -l` + offset | Every pool → dev merge (offset = +1 in cycle 0, +0 in cycle 1+) |

`bin/version` computes all three; every other tool calls it (`claim-dev-merge.sh`, `claim-main-release.sh`, `open-pr.sh`, `auto-rebase-pools-after-dev-merge.sh`).

### Claim-on-Merge Semantics

Because work happens in parallel and completion order can't be predicted, **the version is claimed by whichever PR merges first** - not assigned at branch creation. Working branches carry an `nN` sequence number, not a version.

Flow for `pool/...` → `dev`:

1. PR is approved and merged into `dev` (--no-ff produces a merge commit on dev's first-parent line)
2. Post-merge hook fires `claim-dev-merge.sh` which calls `bin/version --seal` → returns `vYEAR.SERIES.DEV` reflecting the just-landed merge
3. Publish dev (only forward, or onto the amended twin of the same merge), then `git tag -a $SEAL` on the merge commit and push the tag; a tag never reaches origin before origin dev carries its commit
4. Seal any earlier dev merge that spent a number without a claim, with the number it spent in its own year and cycle (`bin/version --seal --at <merge>`), and push every claim tag origin lacks, so the tag chain has no holes; existing tags never move
5. (Optional) `auto-rebase-pools-after-dev-merge.sh` rebases other open pool branches against the new dev tip + updates their PR aspirational titles

Flow for `dev` → `main`:

1. PR is approved and merged into `main` via **--no-ff** (REQUIRED - the merge commit on main's first-parent line is what countability depends on)
2. Post-merge hook fires `claim-main-release.sh` which calls `bin/version --release-tag` → returns the SAME value as the latest dev tag (release reuses dev tag)
3. **No new git tag is created.** A GitHub Release object is created/attached to the existing dev tag via `gh release create`. The build pipeline (`ci-dispatch.yml`'s tag trigger) attaches the build artifact.
4. Safety anchors are not touched at release time. Under the stay-forever rule every `safety/` ref persists for the life of the repo regardless of release state; the release-claim script enumerates no safety branches.

Year-rollover behavior: the first merge after Jan 1 UTC reads `YYYY` from the clock; `DEV` resets to 0 + 1 = 1 (counts the new merge). No scheduled job - purely lazy.

Both claim scripts are also wrapped by remote workflows (`ci-dispatch.yml`'s pr-merge-dev and pr-merge-main triggers) that fire automatically on push to the target branch. Each workflow additionally accepts a manual `workflow_dispatch` trigger gated on the dispatching actor holding the admin role per GitHub's collaborators permission API; this is the operator escape when the automatic push run does not complete. Each workflow wraps the canonical script invocation in an exponential-backoff retry loop (8 attempts, capped at 5 minutes between attempts) with a 4320 minute job timeout so transient GitHub API or network failures during tag push or Release creation ride out without surfacing as a workflow failure. The scripts themselves are idempotent (tag-exists check on dev, no-new-tag on main) so each retry is safe.

---

## Hook Architecture

Two complementary layers.

### Local hooks - validation & guardrails

Versioned in `.io.v4rian.neo-git/githooks/`, activated with
`git config core.hooksPath .io.v4rian.neo-git/githooks` (auto-applied
by the in-repo scripts on first run via `scripts/_lib.sh`'s
`ensure_hooks_path`; no setup step required).

- `pre-commit` - scrub em-dashes and en-dashes from staged prose files (code and data keep their bytes)
- `prepare-commit-msg` - smart auto-fix layer (dash scrub, banned-word replacement, [TAG] derivation from staged diff shape, description sentence cap, third-person bullet rewrite); opt out with `NEO_GIT_AUTOFIX=0` or `git config neogit.autofix false`, never applied to rebase or cherry-pick replays
- `commit-msg` - subject-length guardrail plus the message rules (no em/en dash, no "plus" in prose, no Claude co-author trailer), enforced whether or not the auto-fix ran
- `pre-push` - reject pushed destination refs whose names don't match the `(pool|safety)/[vYYYY.MAIN/]nN.kind.short_name` format (`HG_BRANCH_RE` in `scripts/_lib.sh`) and re-check the message rules on newly published working-branch commits
- `post-checkout` - warn early at branch creation
- `post-merge` - auto-claim version on dev and main when a PR merge lands locally via `git pull`

These keep malformed branches and bad commits off the remote and
auto-reconcile what is mechanically reconcilable. They are bypassable
(`--no-verify`) and are **not** enforcement. The deterministic
enforcement of compile, coverage, runtime, and the offline test
suites runs asynchronously in CI via
`.github/workflows/ci-dispatch.yml`, which runs every
`ci/{tests,audits}/push/required.*.sh` script as a separate check on
the **push** event (the `pull_request` event is intentionally not a
trigger); the PR then reuses those results by matching status-check
context name, so each gate surfaces as a required status check on PRs
to dev without re-running. The framework's own four required.* gates
live under the sys layer at `.io.v4rian.neo-git/ci/`.

### CI - enforcement & source of truth

GitHub Actions (or equivalent) runs on push to `dev` and `main`:

- On `dev` merge: tag the merge commit with the current dev version (internal, no release), commit the `dev_counter` bump. The paired `safety/…` branch already exists from branch-creation time and is left in place.
- On `main` merge: tag the merge commit with the current release version, **promote the tag to a public GitHub Release** (with auto-generated notes), commit the `main_counter` bump and reset `dev_counter` to 1. **No `safety/…` branch is deleted** - under the stay-forever rule every safety anchor persists for the life of the repo regardless of release state.

The atomic version claim happens here, because only the remote can
serialize PR merges.

### Branch Protection (required)

- `main`: PR required, CI green, ≥1 review, no direct push, no force-push
- `dev`: PR required, CI green, no direct push
- **Branch creation restricted** on `pool/*` and `safety/*` patterns:
  only the automation bot identity can create new branches matching those
  patterns. Developers' attempts to push new branches matching those
  patterns are rejected at the server. Implement via GitHub Repository
  Rules ("Restrict creations") or equivalent on other forges.

---

## Hotfix Policy

Hotfixes follow the same path as any other change - there is no
out-of-band route to `main`:

- Allocate a working branch via the endpoint: `pool/nN.fix.JIRA-XXX-short_name`
- Branch is created from current `dev` HEAD (not `main`). If `dev` has
  diverged in ways that complicate the fix, an admin can re-base the
  branch onto a `main`-derived point.
- PR back into `dev`. Merge follows the standard `pool/ → dev` flow:
  safety snapshot created, dev_counter bumped, internal tag applied.
- Immediately open `dev → main` PR to promote the fix. Standard
  `dev → main` flow: `main_counter` bumps, public Release published.

Going through `dev` even for hotfixes preserves the invariant that
`main` only ever sees integrated, CI-verified changes. Speed comes from
PR-review urgency, not from bypassing the pipeline.

If a true bypass is ever required (e.g. catastrophic incident,
integration tests offline), it is an **admin override** documented in
the incident, not a policy.

---

## Design Rationale

The why behind each load-bearing decision, in one place. Each choice below
was made deliberately; treat a proposal that reverses one as a design
change, not a cleanup.

### Tags are the seal (no VERSION file)

A stored version file is a second source of truth that drifts, conflicts on
every parallel branch, and needs a bot commit per release. Tags derive the
version FROM history (first-parent merge counts), so the repo state can
never disagree with itself: same code, same version, computed identically
by every checkout. The file model was tried and scrapped (HG-S02).

### Safety anchors are immutable

A `safety/nN.…` branch is the pre-merge snapshot of exactly what was
reviewed. Rewriting or pruning one silently invalidates the audit trail
its pool branch was accepted under. Every anchor stays for the life of the
repo, released or abandoned: no claim or release script deletes one (see
Safety Branches), and abandoned work's anchor is its only copy.

### Hooks are guardrails, CI is authoritative

Hooks run on the developer's machine and can be skipped, stale, or absent;
nothing developer-side can be the enforcement layer. Hooks exist to catch
shape errors in seconds instead of minutes; the same rules re-run
server-side as required checks, implemented once and called from both
sides (never duplicated with different logic).

### One implementation, two modes

Connected and off-grid mode run the SAME claim scripts; only the caller
differs (workflow vs admin CLI). A separate off-grid implementation would
fork the ceremony logic and drift. Mode is a marker file, the gate is a
one-line check at each entry point, and every workflow no-ops gracefully
where it cannot run.

### Hidden namespace, zero identity pinning

Everything ships under `.io.v4rian.neo-git/` so a consumer's repo root
stays theirs. No owner, repo, path, or token is ever hardcoded: identity
derives from `remote.origin.url` at run time (HG-R021), which is what
makes the same vendored copy valid in any clone, fork, or mirror.
Commit identity follows the same rule: `bin/identity` derives it from
the origin's GitHub org through the overridable `identity-map`, and
`commit-msg` / `pre-push` refuse any other (see README).

### Commit identity follows the origin's org

Every commit, merge, `[REQ]` allocation and claim tag is authored as the
account that belongs to the GitHub org of `remote.origin.url`, passed per
command through `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`, `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`
and `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`. Neither `git config user.*` nor the machine's
global identity is ever the source, and the repo config is never changed;
the org-to-account map belongs to the installation, not the framework. The
one exception: commits rebuilt from the user's own snapshots, zips or
dropped folders are authored as that user. `bin/identity --export` resolves
the four variables and the hooks refuse a mismatched email or name. In a
real CI run (`GITHUB_ACTIONS=true` with a `GITHUB_RUN_ID`) the workflow's
configured bot identity authors the ceremony commits instead.

### Claude judgment is additive, never load-bearing

Deterministic gates (compile, coverage, runtime, offline suites) are hard
requirements. Claude-driven audits add semantic judgment on top, and every
unavailability path (no CLI, no credentials) WARNs and passes rather than
turning a check red (HG-R135) - the pipeline must be fully operable on
git alone.

### Vendored copy, not a dependency

Consumers embed the framework as plain files, migrated by three-way diff
keyed on the SPEC provenance stamp - no submodules, no package manager, no
daemon. Anything that adds an install step or a runtime dependency
contradicts the clone-and-push contract on the README's first line.

## Open Questions

All previously open items are resolved by the current model. This section
will be repopulated as new questions surface during implementation.
