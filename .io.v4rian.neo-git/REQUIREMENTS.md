# neo-git - Requirements

> Single-doc requirements register (project-reqs skill, 1-doc version).
> Lifecycle: intent → in-progress → done   (off-ramps: blocked, scrapped)
> Protection: every Hard Requirement is protected until explicitly scrapped.
> JIRA: a ticket is a Unit of Intent until its sprint is active, then it promotes.
> Storage: Markdown. (A GravityDB-backed register may supersede the storage layer without changing the model - tracked as HG-I09, not scheduled.)
>
> **Register basis** - `dev` @ `0b65c67` (`v2026.0.102`, PRs #129/#105/#130 merged), 2026-05-29.
> Sourced from a full inventory: 174 requirement statements extracted from the docs,
> 46 bin/script files, 7 workflows, 6 hooks, 4 rulesets, 14 skills, and the test surface
> (381 active automated tests - 321 lifecycle e2e + 60 hooks - all green, + 21 parked).
> `Source` is `internal` for every row: neo-git carries no active JIRA sprint, so all
> requirements are **locked internal invariants**. Original capability-area IDs (e.g.
> `BOOTSTRAP-05`) are preserved in `Trace` for lineage.
>
> **Tests legend** - `✅ lifecycle`/`✅ hooks` = covered by an offline suite that runs in the
> push-trigger CI gate · `⚠️ needs units` = tracked test gap (not run by CI per-push) · the
> `⚠️` rows ARE the test backlog the "implement missing tests" + "100% CI coverage" phases close.

## Status at a glance

| Lens | Answer |
|---|---|
| **Status** | 239 Hard Requirements, **all done** (framework feature-complete on `dev`; +3 from merged PRs #129/#105/#130). Design ≈96% complete; testing-run-by-CI ≈82%. |
| **Protected (can't break)** | all 239 Hard Requirements; the P0 lifecycle invariants are the release-blockers. |
| **Needs test units** | After n125 all offline-feasible gaps are closed; only two genuinely live-only items remain - HG-R175 (server-side rule enforcement: a non-admin actually being rejected) and HG-R220 (the real `acli` submit) - both exercised by the canary workflow rather than the per-push offline suite. |
| **What to add next** | 2 pending sym9 requests (Phase 0, specs not yet published) + 6 deferred intents. |

## Hard Requirements
<!-- Committed + protected. Locked internal invariants. A regression against any row is a release-blocker. -->

| HG-R005 | `bin/bootstrap-ci` is the canonical one-shot repo setup: idempotent, safe to re-run, `--check` read-only, `--dry-run` prints every API call. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `bin/bootstrap-ci`, `scripts/bootstrap-ci-steps.sh` · BOOTSTRAP-05 |

| HG-R009 | bootstrap-ci applies branch protection on main + dev via `apply-repo-rules.sh`. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/apply-repo-rules.sh` · BOOTSTRAP-09 |
| HG-R010 | bootstrap-ci applies Repository Rules (`pool-creations`, `safety-lockdown`, `vault-readonly`). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `rulesets/*.json` · BOOTSTRAP-10 |
| HG-R011 | bootstrap-ci binds required status checks: offline-test-suites on PRs to dev+main, plus commit-audit/compile/coverage/runtime/reconcile/opened-via-correct-flow on PRs to dev (seven dev contexts total). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/bootstrap-ci-steps.sh` · BOOTSTRAP-11 |

| HG-R018 | Each bootstrap-ci step probes current state via GET and mutates only on detected drift (idempotent). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/bootstrap-ci-steps.sh` · BOOTSTRAP-18 |
| HG-R019 | Manual clone path: clone → `rm -rf .git` → `git init` → customize → commit → push to main; hooks activate on first script run. | P2 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `README.md` · BOOTSTRAP-19 |
| HG-R020 | All framework content lives under hidden namespace `.io.v4rian.neo-git/`; consumer root carries only `.gitignore` + generated version artifacts. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `.io.v4rian.neo-git/` · BOOTSTRAP-20 |

### ALLOCATOR

|----|-------------|-----|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| HG-R038 | Branch creation is a synchronous repo-owned operation; the only non-CI identity the creation restriction trusts. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `.github/workflows/allocate-pool-branch.yml` · ALLOCATOR-01 |
| HG-R039 | Allocator accepts kind, optional sprint, optional JIRA ref, short slug. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-02 |
| HG-R040 | Allocator atomically allocates next `nN` (1 + max over pool, safety, vault refs, landing subjects and off-grid reservations). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-03 |
| HG-R041 | Allocator atomically creates both pool + safety from current dev HEAD. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-04 |

| HG-R044 | Caller receives a structured error (not a hang/timeout) within 10s on failure. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-07 |
| HG-R045 | Two concurrent requests produce two distinct nN values, never the same nN twice (off-grid: reservation ref in the pair's transaction). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-08 |

| HG-R047 | Callers include JIRA, the `create-pool-branch` CLI, and other automations; the repo owns naming/allocation regardless of caller. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `bin/create-pool-branch` · ALLOCATOR-10 |
| HG-R048 | Allocator runs as a GitHub-Actions identity with contents:write, restricted by Repository Rules to be the only path to a remote pool/safety branch. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `.github/workflows/allocate-pool-branch.yml` · ALLOCATOR-11 |
| HG-R049 | `bin/create-pool-branch` is the local CLI wrapper that dispatches the in-repo allocator workflow via `gh workflow run` (no standalone service). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `bin/create-pool-branch` · ALLOCATOR-12 |
| HG-R050 | CLI is synchronous, reads token from `gh auth token`/env, prints branch name + checkout one-liner on success, structured error + non-zero on failure. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `bin/create-pool-branch` · ALLOCATOR-13 |
| HG-R051 | CLI `--dry-run` validates input and shows what would be created without calling the endpoint. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `bin/create-pool-branch` · ALLOCATOR-14 |
| HG-R052 | `--requirement` text becomes the body of the initial `[REQ]` commit (rule-scrubbed) AND is written verbatim to the lane's own `requirements/<pool ref with / as __>` (legacy lanes: the shared `active-requirement`). | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-15 |
| HG-R053 | `--requirement-file` reads requirement from a file; JIRA Automation passes it via `client_payload.requirement`. | P2 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-16 |
| HG-R054 | Allocator workflow handles idempotent JIRA-key reuse detection + optional Claude kind classification with retry. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `.github/workflows/allocate-pool-branch.yml` · ALLOCATOR-17 |
| HG-R055 | The pool+safety pair is built atomically in one allocator run (post-hoc pair-safety workflow retired). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-18 |
| HG-R056 | The paired safety anchor stays at the pristine dev tip (one commit behind the pool branch by construction). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` · ALLOCATOR-19 |

| HG-R067 | Per-commit semantic claude judgment covers tag fit, fabricated symbols, non-atomic mixing, body-vs-diff contradiction. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (offline mock) | internal | `ci/audits/push/required.commit-audit.sh` · COMMIT-11 |
| HG-R068 | `bin/smart-commit` composes a message via a sub-claude loading in-repo audit skills; stages by name (never `git add -A`); `--dry-run`/`--message-only`/`--yes`. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `bin/smart-commit` · COMMIT-12 |
| HG-R069 | No `claude` CLI required at commit or push time (deterministic structural lens is the hard gate). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle | internal | `githooks/prepare-commit-msg` · COMMIT-13 |

### CONSUMER-LIFECYCLE + RELEASE-INTEGRITY (landed 2026-07-02, n149-n160)

| ID | Requirement | Pri | Status | Tests | Source | Trace |
|----|-------------|-----|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| HG-R240 | Consumer repos carry SPEC provenance (source, ref, tag, stamped) written only by the vendoring tools; the framework source never carries SPEC and SPEC never participates in version derivation. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (attach + sync-framework tests) | internal | `scripts/_lib.sh` (get_spec_field, stamp_spec) · n149 |
| HG-R241 | doctor --consumer runs read-only readiness diagnostics for a consumer install: vendored dir, hooksPath, MODE validity, SPEC provenance (absent = warning), override obligations. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (doctor consumer readiness) | internal | `bin/doctor` · n150 |
| HG-R242 | ci-local runs the layered ci tree locally when Actions is off, reusing the dispatcher's own discovery walk and env contract, with required versus advisory exit semantics. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (ci-local enumerates + filters) | internal | `bin/ci-local` · n151 |
| HG-R243 | attach vendors the framework into an existing repository as one atomic adoption commit: connected MODE, SPEC stamped, workflows wired, ignore entries appended, dev seeded, hooks activated; refuses targets already carrying a copy. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (attach adopts an existing repo) | internal | `bin/attach`, `scripts/attach.sh` · n152 |
| HG-R244 | sync-framework migrates a consumer's vendored copy to any framework revision, up or down, by three-way apply of the source diff with consumer-owned state excluded, restamping SPEC to the target. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (sync-framework migrates the vendored copy) | internal | `bin/sync-framework`, `scripts/sync-framework.sh` · n153 |
| HG-R245 | The doc-freshness gate's opt-in claude worker rewrites stale tracked docs in place and commits them, pushing the PR head only under an explicit push opt-in; every unavailability path warns without reddening the check. | P2 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (doc-freshness gate, canned worker) | internal | `scripts/workflows/doc-freshness-check.sh` · n154 |
| HG-R246 | Every v* tag build is a release-type compile (BUILD_TYPE=release exported to build.sh); promotion reuses the dev tag's artifact without a rebuild, so debug configurations never produce tagged artifacts. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (build-retry exports release BUILD_TYPE) | public | `scripts/workflows/build-retry.sh`, `scripts/build.sh` · n158 |
| HG-R247 | The release artifact audit bans debug code and debug builds from tag artifacts: deterministic hard gate (debug-named outputs, source maps, debugger statements, tarball payloads extracted) plus an additive claude inspection, enforcing when it runs and warning when unavailable. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (artifact audit ×3) | public | `scripts/workflows/release-artifact-audit.sh` · n158 |
| HG-R248 | The release test surface proves tag artifacts run as intended before distribution: portability report (file type, Mach-O minos floor), generic run checks, and a consumer override obligation mirrored in doctor. | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (release-test ×3 + doctor obligation) | public | `scripts/release-test.sh` · n158 |
| HG-R249 | finalize-pool-merge resolves the merged pool branch under both the flat and the prefixed pool/vYYYY.MAIN/nN layouts. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (finalize resolves prefixed pool branch) | internal | `bin/finalize-pool-merge` · n156 |
| HG-R250 | The gh mock models per-PR mergeability (CONFLICTING override) so conflict paths are testable offline; validate-pr-open's reconcile seeding is suite-locked for both verdicts. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (mock conflicting PRs + reconcile seeding) | internal | `framework-tests/_gh_mock.py` · n160 |
| HG-R251 | Claim ceremonies converge under failure injection: a retry over a sealed dev completes idempotently, and a mid-ceremony push failure never corrupts local state (re-run converges the restored origin). | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (mid-ceremony death + push failure) | internal | `scripts/claim-dev-merge.sh` · n160 |
| HG-R252 | Version math holds at depth: DEV per pool merge, SERIES advance + DEV reset per release across three cycles and twelve merges, and prior-year merges never count toward the current year's counters. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (release cycles + year rollover) | internal | `bin/version` · n160 |
| HG-R253 | The core hooks enforce through the real git entry points: pre-commit scrubs on a real commit, commit-msg rejects on a real commit, pre-push rejects and accepts on a real push. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (hooks fire through real git operations) | internal | `githooks/` · n160 |
| HG-R255 | Commit audit receipts gate: bodies asserting observed behavior name the verifying artifact (Receipts: section); the judge flags unreceipted claims as AUDIT_FAIL receipts, distinct from shape failures; no-claim commits exempt. Promoted from the manual feature-request file (vxtr session, 2026-07-02). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (receipts rubric asserts) | internal | `skills/git-commit-audit` §J, `scripts/_lib.sh` · n161 |
| HG-R256 | Artifact build-number identity: filenames carry the commit short sha, release builds refuse a dirty tree (dev builds labeled dirty), and aged siblings sweep to a recoverable artifact trash, never deleted. Promoted from the manual feature-request file (vxtr, 2026-07-02). | P0 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (sha label + dirty gate + retention) | public | `scripts/build.sh` · n162 |
| HG-R257 | ci-local --archive records each run's verdict chain on refs/v4rian/ci-log, a custom ref outside heads and tags so origin pushes can never trigger workflows; unreachable origins degrade to a local archive with a WARN. Promoted from the off-grid CI feature request's v2 scope (2026-06-28). | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (archive ref chain + origin push) | internal | `bin/ci-local` · n163 |
| HG-R258 | A per-user skills tree (~/.config/neo-git/skills, NEO_GIT_USER_SKILLS_DIR to relocate) overrides any in-repo audit skill by name and adds new ones; every claude-pointing consumer (smart-commit, commit-audit, judge prompts, reconcile) resolves through resolve_skill, with user-only skills merged into smart-commit's referenced set. | P1 | ✅ done | ✅ lifecycle (user skill override resolution) | internal | `scripts/_lib.sh` (resolve_skill, list_user_extra_skills) · n164 |
| HG-R254 | The strategy doc carries a Design Rationale section consolidating the why behind every load-bearing decision; the lifecycle suite's scratch scaffolds never inherit host consumer state. | P2 | ✅ done | ✅ doc-freshness gate + lifecycle (scaffold isolation via connected-mode tests) | internal | `docs/Git_Strategy.md` · n157, `framework-tests/test-lifecycle.sh` · n155 |

## Units of Intent
<!-- NOT binding, NOT protected. Promotes to a Hard Requirement when a sprint activates or an idea is locked. -->

| ID | Intent | Pri | Source | Sprint | Notes |
|----|--------|-----|--------|--------|-------|
| HG-I09 | GravityDB-backed requirements register storage (model unchanged; Markdown remains authoritative until scheduled). | P3 | operator (register header note) | - | Storage-layer swap only; no row semantics change. |
| ~~HG-I01~~ | **Request #1 (tag-regression)** - PROMOTED 2026-05-29 → **HG-R238** (claim no-orphan-tag / restore-dev force-push, PR #130, merged). | - | internal | done | Lineage crumb; lives now as HG-R238. |
| ~~HG-I02~~ | **Request #2 (cleanup-prs)** - PROMOTED 2026-05-29 → **HG-R237** (abandoned-pool-branches helper, PR #105) + **HG-R239** (apply-rules retry, PR #129), both merged. | - | internal | done | Lineage crumb; lives now as HG-R237 + HG-R239. |
| HG-I03 | doc-freshness **auto-rewrite worker**: apply + push the rewritten docs (today detection + block only; `invoke_claude_worker_stub` emits `AUTOFIX_STUB=stub-only-no-real-call`). | P2 | internal | - | Genuine internal stub at `scripts/workflows/doc-freshness-check.sh:261`; the gate (block on stale docs, HG-R138) is done. |
| HG-I04 | **User-space claude-skills** override + expansion folder. | P3 | internal | - | Explicitly deferred to a later release per user direction (CHANGELOG). |
| HG-I05 | **Off-grid allocation** (pool/safety pair creation while off-grid). | P3 | internal | - | Shipped: `bin/create-pool-branch` runs `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` locally (RUNBOOK "Off-grid allocation"); only `bin/bootstrap-offgrid` remains open. |
| HG-I06 | **JIRA → endpoint webhook automation** (the JIRA-Automation → `gh workflow run` rule itself, end to end). | P3 | internal | - | Marked out-of-scope/separate-work in the docs; ingress + routing client-side are done (HG-R218). |
| HG-I07 | Framework's **own first dev→main release** (chicken-and-egg: `Use this template` is fully canonical only after the first release). | P1 | internal | - | Operational milestone, not code; tracked so it is not forgotten. |
| HG-I08 | **Re-evaluate `allow_force_pushes=true` on `dev`** - it enables the claim-amend force-push but lets any `contents:write` identity force-push the shared branch. Design a posture that normalizes the merge subject without a protected-branch history rewrite (merge-time `merge_commit_title`, or a fast-forward-safe tag-only claim). | P2 | internal | **next major version sprint** | Deferred by Joel 2026-05-29; do NOT act now. See final design-gaps report. |

## Scrapped
<!-- Graveyard. Kept for traceability. Never deleted. -->

| ID | Requirement | Scrapped | Why |
|----|-------------|----------|-----|
| HG-S01 | Standalone branch-creator HTTP service (`POST /v1/branches`, separate stack/deploy). | 2026-05 | Superseded by the in-repo allocator workflow (`allocate-pool-branch.yml` + `scripts/allocate-pool-branch.sh` + `bin/create-pool-branch`). README spec retained at `services/branch-creator/` for historical reference. Allocator requirements (HG-R038…R056) are the live replacement. |
| HG-S02 | Root `VERSION` file storage model (CI reads/updates a tracked VERSION file). | 2026-05 | Superseded by tags-as-seal; a stray root VERSION now triggers a heal warning + deletion (HG-R119). IMPLEMENTATION_HANDOFF still documents the old model as historical. |
